## Project Overview

This project is a web application that displays Korean menus. It fetches data from an external API and presents it to the user in a searchable and filterable format.

## Technologies

The project is built with the following technologies:

*   **HTML:** The core markup language for the web page.
*   **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework for styling the user interface.
*   **jQuery:** A JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How to Work with the Codebase

When working on this project, please keep the following in mind:

*   The main application logic is contained within the `index.html` file.
*   The application fetches menu data from an external API, which is specified in the `index.html` file.
*   The user interface is styled with Bootstrap, and custom styles are defined in the `assets/css/theme.min.css` file.
*   The application uses a variety of JavaScript libraries, which are located in the `assets/vendor` directory.

When making changes to the codebase, please ensure that you do not break any of the existing functionality. You can test your changes by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
